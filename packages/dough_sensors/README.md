## How to use

This package provides squishy widgets you can use right out of the box. Optionally, you can create custom Dough widgets for a custom squish effect. See the main [Dough Project](https://pub.dev/packages/dough) for details on how to do that.

<br>

### Gyro Dough

Wrap any widget in `GyroDough` to make it squish based on how a user moves their phone around in physical space. This widget only works on devices that have accelerometer/gyroscope features.

```
GyroDough(
    child: Container( ... ),
);
```

You can find a full example of how to use this widget [here](example/lib/demos/gyro_dough_demo.dart).

## Customize how the Dough feels

If you don't like the default dough settings, you can easily change how the dough feels. See docs [here](../dough/README.md#customize-how-the-dough-feels).
